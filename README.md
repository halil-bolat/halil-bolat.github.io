# Blackjack Game Project

## Rules
 The main objective in Blackjack is to have the closest total to 21 but not above, if you go above 21 you bust. If you bust you lose 2 game points, if your total is lower than the dealers total you will lose 1 point. If dealer busts you will gain 1 point, and if your total is higher than dealers total you will gain 1 game point, if you run out of game points it is Game over and you will start all over again. Your game points would be on top left within a black rectangle, and the total of your hand would be next to 'Player One'. GOOD LUCK!
